# Elastic Collisions Demo: Air Hockey
### AP Physics C Final Project: Alejandro Alonso and Kevin Wang

---
## Summary
This physics simulation is designed to showcase the incredible nature of elastic collisions in 2 Dimensions. As Albert Einstein, one of history's premier physicists, says, "Having fun is the best way to learn." We fully agree with Einstein, and thus we have decided to model our demo around the much-loved game Air Hockey. Every kid, grows up playing a game build entirely on elastic collisions, and in our version, we allow the user to tinker with certain properties of the board and players in order to allow a fuller understanding of elastic collisions in 2D space. Of course, switching to the Physics Concepts tab gives the user a mathematical, verbal, and visual explanation of the physics behind Air Hockey.
